# GoogleBench-Demo
CMake project starter code to use the Google Benchmark library

## Build and Run

Run the following commands. The only requirements are `CMake` version 3.14+ and a C++ compiler with C++14 support.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamtinTJB/GoogleBench-Demo
cd GoogleBench-Demo
CMake -B build
cd build
make
```

When `make` completes, there will be an executable with the name `g_bench`. Run it using:
```bash
./g_bench
```
